## 50 Questions on Crypto Finance, Economics, Jargon & Indonesian Regulations

---

### Question 1
In December 2013, a Bitcoin forum user posted a typo-filled rant titled "I AM HODLING" while drunk, explaining why he refused to sell during a price crash despite being a bad trader. What investment philosophy does "HODL" now represent in crypto culture?

- A) A sophisticated algorithmic trading strategy developed by professional quants
- B) Holding through volatility rather than panic selling ✓
- C) An official SEC-approved long-term investment approach for retail investors
- D) Selling at predetermined profit targets to lock in guaranteed gains

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. HODL became a meme representing the strategy of holding through market turbulence rather than trying to time the market. Option A is wrong; it's the opposite of sophisticated—it's deliberately simple. Option C is false; the SEC has no such designation. Option D describes the opposite behavior.

---

### Question 2
Tether (USDT) launched in 2014 to give traders a way to hold dollar-equivalent value on crypto exchanges without converting back to actual USD, which was slow and expensive. What primary problem do stablecoins solve that regular dollars cannot?

- A) Stablecoins pay significantly higher interest rates than traditional savings accounts
- B) They move dollar value on blockchain rails 24/7 without banking limitations ✓
- C) They are legally required by all major exchanges for cryptocurrency trading
- D) Regular dollars fundamentally cannot be used for any online purchases

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. Stablecoins enable instant, 24/7 transfers globally without bank hours, wire fees, or geographic restrictions. Option A is sometimes true in DeFi but not the primary purpose. Option C is false; exchanges accept fiat directly. Option D is obviously wrong.

---

### Question 3
Indonesia treats cryptocurrency as a commodity tradeable on futures exchanges rather than as currency or securities, placing it under specific regulatory oversight. Which government body has primary authority over crypto trading in Indonesia?

- A) Bank Indonesia, the nation's central bank and monetary authority
- B) Bappebti (Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency) ✓
- C) OJK (Financial Services Authority) which oversees banks and securities
- D) The Ministry of Finance through direct regulatory intervention

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. Since crypto is classified as a commodity in Indonesia, it falls under Bappebti, which regulates commodity futures trading. Option A (Bank Indonesia) oversees currency and payment systems but has banned crypto as payment. Option C (OJK) handles securities and banking. Option D is incorrect; the Ministry doesn't directly regulate crypto trading.

---

### Question 4
Crypto communities constantly warn newcomers to "DYOR" before investing, especially for new tokens promoted by influencers or anonymous developers. What does this acronym mean and why is it crucial advice?

- A) "Deposit Your Own Reserves"—advice about maintaining proper collateral ratios
- B) "Do Your Own Research"—because scams are common and losses aren't reimbursed ✓
- C) "Diversify Your Own Risk"—standard portfolio allocation advice from professionals
- D) "Document Your Own Records"—for tax compliance and regulatory purposes

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. The unregulated nature of crypto means scams, rug pulls, and failed projects are common. No one will refund your losses, so personal due diligence is essential. Option A, C, and D are made-up meanings that don't match the actual community usage.

---

### Question 5
Crypto markets famously crashed 80%+ in 2018 and again in 2022, but also saw gains of over 1000% in bull runs—far more extreme than typical stock market cycles. Why do cryptocurrency markets experience more dramatic boom-bust cycles than traditional markets?

- A) Crypto only trades during limited business hours, concentrating all volatility
- B) 24/7 trading, high leverage, and speculative retail participation amplify moves ✓
- C) Government agencies deliberately manipulate prices to create artificial volatility
- D) Bull and bear market cycles only exist in traditional stock markets

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. Crypto trades nonstop, many exchanges offer 100x leverage, and retail speculation dominates—all amplifying price swings. Option A is backwards; crypto trades 24/7. Option C is conspiracy thinking. Option D is obviously false given crypto's history.

---

### Question 6
When Bitcoin hit $69,000 in November 2021, crypto Twitter exploded with posts celebrating that their coins had "mooned." What market event does this slang term describe?

- A) A cryptocurrency being officially delisted from all major trading exchanges
- B) Dramatic price increases, often by multiples, in a short period ✓
- C) Achieving full regulatory approval and compliance in a new country
- D) The core development team abandoning a project and disappearing

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. "Mooning" or "going to the moon" describes rapid, dramatic price appreciation—the dream of every speculative investor. Option A describes the opposite situation. Option C is unrelated to the term. Option D describes a rug pull, not mooning.

---

### Question 7
During market downturns, negative news spreads rapidly through crypto social media, sometimes based on rumors or exaggerated claims that trigger panic selling regardless of accuracy. What does "FUD" stand for and how does it affect markets?

- A) "Fully Utilized Deposits"—a technical banking reserve metric for institutions
- B) "Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt"—negativity that triggers selling pressure ✓
- C) "Future Utility Development"—a project roadmap term for upcoming features
- D) "Funded User Distribution"—an airdrop mechanism for token allocation

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. FUD describes negative sentiment—whether legitimate concerns or deliberate misinformation—that causes fear-based selling. Option A, C, and D are fabricated meanings not used in crypto communities.

---

### Question 8
Centralized exchanges like Binance and Coinbase require users to submit ID documents and selfies before allowing full trading access, a process that can take days and feels invasive to privacy-focused users. Why do exchanges require KYC verification?

- A) KYC is completely optional and only unlocks minor premium features
- B) Regulations require identity verification to prevent money laundering ✓
- C) KYC is only needed for withdrawals exceeding one million US dollars
- D) Exchanges primarily sell user identity data to third-party advertisers

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws in most jurisdictions require financial services to verify customer identities. Exchanges must comply or face legal consequences. Option A is false; most exchanges require KYC for basic functions. Option C understates requirements. Option D is false for reputable exchanges.

---

### Question 9
A cryptocurrency with a $1 billion market cap and 1 billion tokens has a $1 price, but if everyone tried to sell, the price would crash long before $1 billion was extracted. Why can market cap be misleading when evaluating cryptocurrencies?

- A) Market cap calculations are usually mathematically incorrect due to data errors
- B) It doesn't reflect liquidity—large sells would crash the price ✓
- C) Market cap metrics only measure institutional holdings, not retail investors
- D) Exchanges set market caps arbitrarily without any formula or calculation

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. Market cap = price × supply, but this assumes infinite liquidity at current price. In reality, selling pressure moves prices down. A $1B market cap might have only $10M in actual buy orders. Option A is wrong; the math is simple. Option C misunderstands the metric. Option D is false; it's a straightforward calculation.

---

### Question 10
Indonesian crypto traders can use locally registered exchanges like Indodax, Tokocrypto, and Pintu that comply with Bappebti regulations, or access international platforms that may offer more features but less legal protection. What distinguishes registered from unregistered exchanges in Indonesia?

- A) There is absolutely no practical difference between them for users
- B) Registered exchanges offer legal recourse; unregistered ones operate outside Indonesian law ✓
- C) Unregistered international platforms always offer significantly better rates
- D) Only foreign nationals are permitted to use registered Indonesian exchanges

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. Registered exchanges must meet capital requirements, security standards, and provide dispute resolution. Using unregistered platforms means no legal protection if things go wrong. Option A ignores significant legal differences. Option C is not consistently true. Option D is backwards; registered exchanges serve Indonesians.

---

### Question 11
After a leveraged trade goes wrong or someone buys a scam token that goes to zero, crypto communities say that person got "rekt." What does this term mean and what behaviors commonly lead to it?

- A) Successfully predicting a major market movement and profiting significantly
- B) Suffering severe losses from overleveraged positions, FOMO buying, or scams ✓
- C) Having an account officially verified and approved by a major exchange
- D) Making significant profits from a particularly risky and volatile trade

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. "Rekt" (wrecked) means devastated financially—usually from excessive leverage, buying tops, or falling for scams. Option A and D describe the opposite outcome. Option C is unrelated to the term's meaning.

---

### Question 12
In 2021, the "Squid Game" token rose 75,000% before developers drained all liquidity and disappeared, leaving investors with worthless tokens they couldn't sell. What is a "rug pull" and what warning signs might indicate one?

- A) A legitimate and standard exit strategy for startup founders and early investors
- B) Developers draining funds after attracting investment—watch for anonymous teams and locked selling ✓
- C) A technical term for routine smart contract upgrades and maintenance procedures
- D) A fair and transparent token distribution mechanism approved by regulators

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. Rug pulls involve developers removing liquidity or dumping tokens, leaving investors holding worthless assets. Warning signs include anonymous teams, inability to sell, and too-good-to-be-true promises. Options A, C, and D completely mischaracterize this scam.

---

### Question 13
Bitcoin might trade at $50,000 on Binance but $50,050 on Coinbase at the same moment due to different buyer and seller activity on each platform. How do arbitrage traders profit from these price differences?

- A) They petition exchanges to manually equalize all prices across platforms
- B) They buy on the cheaper exchange and sell on the expensive one ✓
- C) Price differences are strictly illegal and immediately corrected by regulators
- D) Only exchange employees are permitted to arbitrage between platforms

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. Arbitrageurs exploit price discrepancies by buying low and selling high simultaneously across venues, pocketing the difference. This activity actually helps equalize prices. Option A isn't how markets work. Option C is false; arbitrage is legal. Option D is wrong; anyone can arbitrage.

---

### Question 14
DeFi protocols sometimes advertise APYs of 1000% or more for depositing tokens, attracting users seeking passive income far beyond traditional savings rates. Why are extremely high yield farming returns often unsustainable?

- A) High yields are fully guaranteed by comprehensive smart contract insurance
- B) Returns often come from inflationary token emissions that dilute value over time ✓
- C) DeFi yields are carefully regulated and capped by central banking authorities
- D) Yield farming has absolutely no risks whatsoever for participants

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. Sky-high APYs typically come from newly minted tokens—but as more tokens are created, each becomes worth less. Early farmers often profit while latecomers lose. Option A is false; insurance is rare and limited. Option C is wrong; DeFi is largely unregulated. Option D is dangerously false.

---

### Question 15
During the 2021 bull market, crypto Twitter adopted "WAGMI" as a rallying cry, with communities using it to maintain optimism even during temporary dips. What does this acronym mean?

- A) "Withdraw All Gains, Minimize Investment"—a conservative risk management strategy
- B) "We're All Gonna Make It"—expressing collective optimism ✓
- C) "Watch And Guard My Investment"—a security-focused monitoring approach
- D) "Worldwide Association of Global Market Investors"—an industry trade group

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. WAGMI expresses shared optimism and community solidarity—the belief that holding together will lead to collective success. Options A, C, and D are fabricated meanings.

---

### Question 16
When you provide liquidity to a Uniswap pool with ETH and USDC, you might deposit when ETH is $2000 but withdraw when it's $3000, only to find you have less value than if you'd simply held both tokens. What causes "impermanent loss" for liquidity providers?

- A) Exchange platform fees gradually eating into your deposited capital
- B) The pool rebalancing gives you more of the token that dropped in relative value ✓
- C) Hackers stealing small portions of liquidity pools over extended periods
- D) Impermanent loss is merely a temporary display bug that corrects itself

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. AMMs constantly rebalance to maintain price ratios. When prices diverge, you end up with more of the cheaper token and less of the expensive one compared to just holding. Option A is separate from IL. Option C describes hacks, not IL. Option D misunderstands; IL is real and can become permanent.

---

### Question 17
Coinbase holds your private keys and can freeze your account, while Uniswap lets you trade directly from your own wallet but has no customer support if you make mistakes. What are the key trade-offs between centralized (CEX) and decentralized (DEX) exchanges?

- A) CEX and DEX function completely identically with just different branding
- B) CEX offers convenience and support but requires trust; DEX offers self-custody but more complexity ✓
- C) DEX platforms always provide significantly better prices than any CEX
- D) CEX platforms are exclusively designed for institutional investors only

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. CEXs are user-friendly with support but hold your funds (counterparty risk). DEXs give you control but require more knowledge and offer no recourse for mistakes. Option A ignores fundamental differences. Option C isn't consistently true. Option D is false; CEXs serve retail users.

---

### Question 18
Indonesian tax authorities have increasingly focused on cryptocurrency as adoption grows, though specific guidance continues to evolve and many traders remain uncertain about compliance. How are cryptocurrency gains generally taxed in Indonesia?

- A) Cryptocurrency is completely and permanently tax-exempt in Indonesia
- B) Crypto transactions are subject to income tax and VAT on trading fees ✓
- C) Only losses can be claimed for tax deductions, never any gains
- D) Taxes only apply to holdings exceeding ten billion Indonesian rupiah

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. Indonesia applies income tax to crypto gains and VAT to exchange services. The 2022 regulations clarified that crypto trading incurs 0.1% income tax and 0.11% VAT per transaction. Option A is false. Option C is backwards. Option D has no basis in regulation.

---

### Question 19
During the 2022 crash, some investors who bought Bitcoin at $60,000 refused to sell at $20,000, posting memes about their "diamond hands" while mocking "paper hands" who sold. What do these terms describe?

- A) Different types of hardware wallet security features and specifications
- B) Diamond hands hold through crashes; paper hands sell at the first drop ✓
- C) Diamond hands refers to wealthy investors; paper hands refers to retail
- D) Technical analysis chart patterns used for predicting price movements

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. Diamond hands = strong conviction holders who don't sell during volatility. Paper hands = those who sell quickly when prices drop. It's about psychological resilience, not wealth or technical analysis. Options A, C, and D misunderstand the terms.

---

### Question 20
Before investing in any token, experienced traders analyze its "tokenomics"—examining supply schedules, allocation to insiders, vesting periods, and utility mechanisms. Why is understanding tokenomics crucial for investment decisions?

- A) Tokenomics analysis only matters for obscure meme coins, not serious projects
- B) It reveals whether the economic design supports or undermines long-term value ✓
- C) Tokenomics is simply a type of technical chart analysis for day trading
- D) Only the core development team needs to understand their own tokenomics

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. Poor tokenomics—like high insider allocation, rapid unlocks, or infinite inflation—can doom even good technology. Understanding supply dynamics helps predict selling pressure. Option A is backwards; it matters more for serious investments. Option C confuses tokenomics with TA. Option D ignores investor due diligence.

---

### Question 21
Small-cap cryptocurrencies are vulnerable to coordinated buying campaigns where groups inflate the price through social media hype, then dump their holdings on latecomers who bought the peak. What is a "pump and dump" scheme?

- A) A legitimate and widely accepted marketing strategy for new cryptocurrency projects
- B) Artificially inflating price then selling to unsuspecting buyers ✓
- C) A standard method of stress-testing network capacity and transaction throughput
- D) An official exchange feature designed for rapid high-frequency order execution

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. Pump and dumps are illegal in traditional markets and unethical everywhere. Organizers buy cheap, hype the token, then sell to FOMO buyers who are left holding worthless bags. Options A, C, and D completely mischaracterize this manipulation scheme.

---

### Question 22
Crypto YouTubers and Twitter influencers often end investment discussions with "NFA" to protect themselves legally while still clearly suggesting viewers should buy specific tokens. What does this disclaimer mean?

- A) "New Financial Asset"—an official regulatory classification for cryptocurrencies
- B) "Not Financial Advice"—attempting to avoid liability for recommendations ✓
- C) "National Finance Authority"—the regulatory body they're registered with
- D) "No Fees Applied"—indicating the promotion is completely commission-free

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. NFA is a legal disclaimer attempting to shield influencers from liability when their "suggestions" cause followers to lose money. Its actual legal effectiveness is questionable. Options A, C, and D are fabricated meanings.

---

### Question 23
Blockchain analytics firms track wallets holding millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency, and when these "whales" move funds to exchanges, it often signals upcoming selling pressure. How do large holders influence cryptocurrency markets?

- A) Whales are simply automated trading bots with no real impact on markets
- B) Their large trades can significantly move prices and signal market direction ✓
- C) Whale is exclusively a term for cryptocurrency exchange operators only
- D) Large wallet movements cannot be tracked on public blockchain networks

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. Whales can move markets with single trades. Watching whale wallets provides signals—exchange deposits often precede sells, withdrawals suggest accumulation. Option A is wrong; whales are real large holders. Option C misdefines the term. Option D is false; blockchain is transparent.

---

### Question 24
When you place a market order to buy $10,000 of a small-cap token, you might expect to pay $1.00 per token but actually receive an average price of $1.05 due to insufficient sell orders at your target price. What is "slippage" in trading?

- A) A security feature that automatically prevents all unauthorized trades
- B) The difference between expected and actual execution price ✓
- C) The time delay between placing an order and its final execution
- D) A special fee charged by exchanges specifically for large orders

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. Slippage occurs when your order consumes available liquidity at your price and must fill at worse prices. Low liquidity = high slippage. Option A describes something else entirely. Option C describes latency, not slippage. Option D confuses slippage with fees.

---

### Question 25
When someone shares a clearly terrible investment decision—like buying a memecoin at the top—crypto communities often respond with "NGMI." What does this acronym mean?

- A) "Next Generation Market Index"—a benchmark for measuring crypto performance
- B) "Not Gonna Make It"—expressing pessimism about someone's choices ✓
- C) "New Global Money Initiative"—an international regulatory framework
- D) "No Guaranteed Minimum Investment"—a standard risk disclosure statement

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. NGMI is the pessimistic counterpart to WAGMI, used to mock poor decisions or express doubt about someone's success. Options A, C, and D are fabricated meanings not used in crypto culture.

---

### Question 26
A token might have 100 million coins circulating, 500 million total created, and a maximum cap of 1 billion—three different numbers that all affect valuation calculations differently. Why do circulating, total, and max supply distinctions matter?

- A) They are simply three different names for the exact same metric
- B) Each affects scarcity calculations and future dilution risk differently ✓
- C) Only maximum supply matters for any investment valuation decisions
- D) These distinctions only apply to Bitcoin, not other cryptocurrencies

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. Circulating supply affects current market cap; total supply shows potential near-term dilution from unlocks; max supply indicates ultimate scarcity. Ignoring locked tokens overstates scarcity. Option A is wrong; they measure different things. Option C ignores important dilution risks. Option D is false; all tokens have these metrics.

---

### Question 27
Traditional exchanges match buyers and sellers through order books, but Uniswap pioneered a different model using smart contracts holding paired token reserves that automatically calculate prices. What is a "liquidity pool"?

- A) Emergency reserve funds held by exchanges for unexpected situations
- B) Token pairs in smart contracts enabling automated trading without order books ✓
- C) A private group of traders coordinating their strategies together
- D) A type of high-yield savings account for cryptocurrency holdings

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. Liquidity pools hold two tokens (like ETH/USDC) and use mathematical formulas to price swaps. Anyone can trade against the pool 24/7 without counterparties. Option A describes something different. Option C describes trading groups, not pools. Option D misunderstands the mechanism.

---

### Question 28
Not all cryptocurrencies can be legally traded in Indonesia—Bappebti maintains an official list of approved assets that registered exchanges must follow. How is the list of tradeable cryptocurrencies determined in Indonesia?

- A) All cryptocurrencies are automatically approved without any restrictions
- B) Bappebti evaluates and whitelists specific assets that exchanges can offer ✓
- C) Each exchange independently decides what tokens to list without oversight
- D) Only Bitcoin and Ethereum are legally permitted in Indonesia

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. Bappebti maintains a whitelist (currently 500+ assets) based on criteria like market cap, liquidity, and legitimacy. Exchanges can only offer approved assets. Option A is false; approval is required. Option C ignores regulatory oversight. Option D understates the approved list.

---

### Question 29
Rather than trying to time the market by buying dips and selling peaks, many long-term investors simply buy a fixed dollar amount of Bitcoin every week or month regardless of price. What is "dollar-cost averaging" and why is it popular?

- A) Converting all cryptocurrency investments back to US dollars regularly
- B) Regular fixed purchases that reduce timing risk and emotional decisions ✓
- C) Only buying cryptocurrency when prices hit verified all-time lows
- D) A strategy that exclusively works for dollar-denominated assets only

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. DCA removes the stress of timing by spreading purchases over time. You buy more when prices are low, less when high, averaging your cost basis. Option A describes selling, not DCA. Option C describes timing, the opposite of DCA. Option D is false; DCA works with any currency.

---

### Question 30
Hedge funds measure performance by "alpha"—returns above what the overall market delivered—distinguishing skill from simply riding market trends. What does "alpha" mean in crypto investing?

- A) The first version of a cryptocurrency protocol before official release
- B) Returns exceeding the market benchmark, indicating skill or edge ✓
- C) A quality ranking system for evaluating different cryptocurrencies
- D) A term exclusively used in traditional stock markets, not crypto

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. Alpha represents outperformance versus a benchmark (like BTC or total market). Positive alpha means you beat the market through skill or information. Option A confuses alpha release with financial alpha. Option C isn't what alpha means. Option D is false; the concept applies to any market.

---

### Question 31
After a major crash, prices sometimes bounce 20-30% as bargain hunters buy the dip, only to resume falling to new lows—trapping those who thought the bottom was in. What is a "dead cat bounce"?

- A) A sustainable recovery pattern signaling the definitive end of a downtrend
- B) A temporary rally during a larger downtrend that traps optimistic buyers ✓
- C) A technical indicator showing strong support levels have been established
- D) When a cryptocurrency project officially shuts down all operations

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. The morbid saying "even a dead cat bounces if dropped from high enough" describes relief rallies that fool buyers before the decline continues. Option A is the opposite interpretation. Option C misunderstands the pattern. Option D is unrelated to the term.

---

### Question 32
DeFi analysts track "TVL" across protocols, with platforms like Aave and Compound competing for billions in deposited assets as a measure of user trust and adoption. What does Total Value Locked indicate?

- A) The total number of registered users on a particular platform
- B) The aggregate value of assets deposited in a protocol's smart contracts ✓
- C) The maximum daily withdrawal limit imposed by the protocol
- D) Total venture capital investment the project has received to date

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. TVL measures how much capital users have entrusted to a protocol—higher TVL suggests more trust and utility. Option A confuses users with value. Option C describes withdrawal limits, not TVL. Option D confuses VC funding with user deposits.

---

### Question 33
When a new token launches with viral marketing, some traders immediately buy without reading the whitepaper or checking the team, hoping to catch early gains before doing any research. What does "aping in" mean?

- A) A careful, methodical, and thoroughly researched investment approach
- B) Buying quickly without research, often driven by FOMO ✓
- C) Systematically copying trades from professional and verified investors
- D) Only investing in well-established blue-chip cryptocurrency tokens

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. "Aping" means jumping in impulsively like an excited ape, prioritizing speed over due diligence. It's high-risk behavior driven by fear of missing out. Option A describes the opposite approach. Option C describes copy trading. Option D describes conservative investing.

---

### Question 34
Keeping large amounts of cryptocurrency on an exchange is convenient for trading but risky if the exchange gets hacked, while hardware wallets are secure but inconvenient for frequent trading. When should you use a hot wallet versus a cold wallet?

- A) Hot wallets for summer months; cold wallets for winter months
- B) Hot wallets for small active amounts; cold wallets for secure long-term storage ✓
- C) Hot wallets process transactions faster; cold wallets are significantly slower
- D) There is absolutely no security difference between the two wallet types

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. Hot wallets (internet-connected) offer convenience for daily use but are vulnerable to hacks. Cold wallets (offline) are secure for savings but inconvenient for frequent access. Option A is a joke answer. Option C misunderstands; transaction speed is network-dependent. Option D ignores significant security differences.

---

### Question 35
Some exchanges offer 100x leverage, meaning a 1% price move against your position wipes out your entire margin—yet traders still use these products hoping to multiply small amounts into fortunes. Why do exchanges offer extreme leverage despite the risks to users?

- A) Leverage is fundamentally a safety feature designed to protect traders
- B) Exchanges profit from fees and liquidations regardless of trader outcomes ✓
- C) High leverage trading is only available to licensed professional traders
- D) Higher leverage mathematically means lower risk due to smaller positions

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. Exchanges earn fees on every trade and often profit when positions are liquidated. More leverage = more trading = more fees, regardless of whether users win or lose. Option A is backwards. Option C is false; retail can access high leverage. Option D is dangerously wrong.

---

### Question 36
When positive news breaks or a token pumps unexpectedly, crypto communities flood social media with "LFG" expressing their excitement and bullish sentiment. What does this acronym mean?

- A) "Low Fee Guarantee"—a promise of minimal transaction costs from exchanges
- B) "Let's F***ing Go"—expressing excitement and enthusiasm ✓
- C) "Liquidity Fund Group"—a type of institutional investment vehicle
- D) "Legal Framework Guidelines"—regulatory compliance documentation

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. LFG is an enthusiastic rallying cry expressing excitement about price action or positive developments. It's pure hype energy. Options A, C, and D are fabricated meanings not used in crypto communities.

---

### Question 37
Professional traders never enter a position without knowing exactly where they'll exit if wrong, using automated orders to limit potential losses before emotions take over during a crash. What is a "stop-loss" order?

- A) A formal request to stop reporting trading losses on tax documents
- B) An automatic sell order triggered at a set price to limit losses ✓
- C) A petition submitted to exchanges requesting reversal of losing trades
- D) Insurance coverage purchased to protect against market crashes

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. Stop-losses automatically sell your position if price drops to a specified level, limiting downside. It's essential risk management. Option A misunderstands the term. Option C isn't how exchanges work. Option D describes insurance, not stop-losses.

---

### Question 38
Some exchanges report billions in daily trading volume, but investigations have revealed that much of this "volume" is fake—the same entity buying and selling to itself to appear more active. What is "wash trading" and why does it matter?

- A) A legitimate method of cleaning cryptocurrency obtained from illegal sources
- B) Fake volume that misleads investors about actual market activity ✓
- C) A standard and accepted market-making strategy used by professionals
- D) Trading that occurs during scheduled exchange maintenance periods

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. Wash trading creates fake volume to make exchanges or tokens appear more liquid and popular than they are, deceiving investors. Option A describes money laundering, different concept. Option C is wrong; wash trading is illegal in regulated markets. Option D is unrelated.

---

### Question 39
When Indonesian exchange Zipmex faced liquidity issues in 2022, users discovered their funds weren't protected like bank deposits, highlighting the risks of centralized crypto platforms. What consumer protections exist for Indonesian crypto investors?

- A) Full government insurance covers all losses up to two billion rupiah
- B) Limited protections exist; crypto isn't covered by deposit insurance like banks ✓
- C) International insurance policies automatically cover all cryptocurrency holdings
- D) Registered exchanges are legally required to reimburse 100% of any losses

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. Unlike bank deposits protected by LPS (Indonesia's deposit insurance), crypto holdings have no government guarantee. Bappebti requires some safeguards but not full insurance. Option A is false; no such insurance exists. Option C is wrong. Option D overstates requirements.

---

### Question 40
Investors who bought Bitcoin at $60,000 often refuse to sell at $30,000, not because of analysis but because selling would mean admitting the loss was real—a psychological trap that can lead to even bigger losses. What is "bag holding"?

- A) A secure and recommended method of cryptocurrency storage
- B) Holding losing investments hoping they'll recover, often due to sunk cost fallacy ✓
- C) Diversifying investments across many different cryptocurrency tokens
- D) Using multiple separate wallets for enhanced security purposes

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. Bag holders are stuck with losing positions they refuse to sell, often because admitting the loss feels worse than the loss itself. This psychological bias can compound losses. Option A misunderstands the term. Option C describes diversification. Option D describes wallet security.

---

### Question 41
Since Bitcoin's launch, it has maintained the largest market cap of any cryptocurrency, but Ethereum has occasionally approached 50% of Bitcoin's value, leading to speculation about a potential overtaking. What is "the flippening"?

- A) The standard process of converting one cryptocurrency to another on exchanges
- B) A hypothetical event where Ethereum's market cap surpasses Bitcoin's ✓
- C) When a cryptocurrency's price changes from negative returns to positive
- D) The daily price reset that occurs at midnight UTC across all exchanges

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. The flippening refers specifically to Ethereum potentially overtaking Bitcoin as the largest cryptocurrency by market cap—a symbolic shift in market dominance. Option A describes swapping. Option C isn't a defined term. Option D doesn't exist.

---

### Question 42
Simply holding ETH in a wallet earns nothing, but depositing it into a staking contract earns approximately 4-5% annually while helping secure the network—though the ETH becomes less liquid. How does staking differ economically from just holding?

- A) Staking and holding produce completely identical returns over time
- B) Staking generates yield but involves lockup periods and smart contract risk ✓
- C) Staking is only available for Bitcoin, not Ethereum or other tokens
- D) Staking guarantees profits with absolutely zero risk to participants

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. Staking earns rewards but introduces risks: lockup periods, slashing penalties, and smart contract vulnerabilities. It's a trade-off between yield and liquidity/risk. Option A ignores staking rewards. Option C is backwards; Bitcoin doesn't have native staking. Option D ignores real risks.

---

### Question 43
Uniswap's UNI token doesn't pay dividends or represent company ownership, but holders can vote on protocol fees, treasury spending, and upgrade decisions. What rights do governance tokens typically grant?

- A) Access to premium customer support services and priority assistance
- B) Voting power on protocol decisions and parameter changes ✓
- C) Legal ownership shares in the company that created the protocol
- D) Guaranteed price appreciation backed by the development team

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. Governance tokens give holders influence over protocol direction—fee structures, treasury allocation, upgrades—without traditional equity rights. Option A isn't typically a governance token feature. Option C misunderstands; tokens aren't equity. Option D is false; no guarantees exist.

### Question 44
When an influencer with millions of followers promotes a small-cap token, their followers often buy in, providing the liquidity for the influencer and early holders to sell at inflated prices. What does "exit liquidity" mean?

- A) The standard process of converting cryptocurrency back to fiat currency
- B) New buyers who purchase from early holders looking to sell ✓
- C) Emergency reserve funds held by exchanges for crisis situations
- D) A specialized type of liquidity pool designed for exiting positions

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. Exit liquidity refers to the buyers (often retail followers) who unknowingly provide the demand for insiders to sell into. It's often used critically to describe exploitation. Option A describes cashing out generally. Option C describes exchange reserves. Option D isn't a real thing.

### Question 45
Before major options expiration dates, Bitcoin's price often gravitates toward specific levels where the most options contracts would expire worthless, as if pulled by an invisible force. What is "max pain" in options trading?

- A) The maximum possible loss that can occur in any single trade
- B) The price where the most options expire worthless, potentially attracting price action ✓
- C) A psychological state experienced by traders during extended bear markets
- D) The all-time high price that a cryptocurrency has ever reached

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. Max pain theory suggests prices gravitate toward levels that cause maximum loss for option buyers (and maximum profit for sellers/market makers). Option A describes maximum loss, different concept. Option C is metaphorical, not technical. Option D describes ATH.

### Question 46
If you bought Bitcoin at $10,000 and it's now worth $50,000, you have a $40,000 gain on paper—but tax treatment may differ depending on whether you've actually sold. What distinguishes realized from unrealized gains?

- A) Realized gains are real and legitimate; unrealized gains are imaginary
- B) Realized gains occur upon selling; unrealized are paper gains that may be taxed differently ✓
- C) Only realized gains exist in cryptocurrency; unrealized is a stock market term
- D) The distinction only applies to traditional investments, not cryptocurrency

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. Unrealized gains exist only on paper until you sell. In most jurisdictions, you're only taxed when you realize gains by selling. Option A misunderstands; unrealized gains are real value, just not yet converted. Option C is false; the concept applies to all assets. Option D is wrong; crypto follows similar tax principles.

### Question 47
Crypto Twitter and Discord developed their own language, with users addressing each other as "ser" (a deliberate misspelling of "sir") regardless of actual gender or formality. What does this usage reveal about crypto culture?

- A) A formal title reserved exclusively for cryptocurrency executives and founders
- B) The informal, meme-driven, and irreverent nature of crypto communities ✓
- C) An official acronym standing for "Secure Exchange Rate" in trading
- D) A term borrowed directly from traditional Wall Street finance culture

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. "Ser" exemplifies crypto's playful, meme-heavy culture that doesn't take itself too seriously while building community through shared language. Option A is backwards; it's informal, not formal. Option C is a fabricated meaning. Option D is wrong; it originated in crypto/internet culture.

### Question 48
When you submit a swap on Uniswap, your pending transaction is visible to everyone, and sophisticated bots can see you're about to buy a token and insert their own buy order ahead of yours, profiting from the price impact you cause. What is MEV front-running?

- A) Being the first person to purchase newly listed tokens on exchanges
- B) Bots inserting transactions ahead of yours to extract value at your expense ✓
- C) Running blockchain nodes faster than other network participants
- D) A fair and legitimate trading mechanism equally available to everyone

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) front-running means bots see your pending trade, buy before you (raising the price), then sell to you at the higher price. You get worse execution. Option A describes something different. Option C misunderstands the term. Option D is misleading; it requires sophisticated infrastructure.

### Question 49
Technical analysts watch for the "death cross"—when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average—as a signal that has historically preceded extended downtrends in both crypto and traditional markets. Why do traders consider this pattern bearish?

- A) It signals that a cryptocurrency project is being officially terminated
- B) Short-term momentum falling below long-term trend suggests weakening price action ✓
- C) The pattern only appears in Bitcoin charts and is irrelevant for other assets
- D) It indicates that trading volume has dropped to absolute zero

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. When short-term average crosses below long-term average, it suggests recent price action is weaker than historical trend—momentum is shifting bearish. Option A misunderstands; it's a chart pattern, not project news. Option C is false; it applies to any asset. Option D is wrong; volume isn't part of this indicator.

### Question 50
When major news breaks—like a country adopting Bitcoin or a major hack—crypto Twitter often responds with "probably nothing," using obvious sarcasm to highlight the significance. What is the speaker actually implying?

- A) They genuinely believe the news is completely unimportant and irrelevant
- B) The news is actually significant, and they're using irony to emphasize it ✓
- C) They have absolutely no opinion on the matter whatsoever
- D) It's an official statement format required by project development teams

> **Rationale:** The correct answer is B. "Probably nothing" is sarcastic—the speaker clearly thinks it's significant. It's a way of highlighting important news while maintaining crypto's ironic, meme-driven communication style. Option A misses the sarcasm entirely. Option C is wrong; they clearly have an opinion. Option D is fabricated.
